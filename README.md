# Ticket Selling Heaven

## Description
How many times have you been frustrated because something came up and you couldn't attend a sporting event you had already bought tickets to? Wouldn't it be nice if you were able to sell the tickets to someone else who wanted to attend the event. How about when you want tickets to a game, but they are already sold out. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to find tickets from someone else who no longer wants to go to the game. It would be a win-win situation because you can attend the game and the person selling the tickets can get their money back for them. This is the issue I will be addressing with my project. I am creating a website that allows people to post tickets to sporting events online in order to sell them. This will be a way for people to scalp tickets from their house, and it will be a way for fans to obtain tickets ahead of time so that they are not trying to get them from a person on the street at the last minute before gameday.
